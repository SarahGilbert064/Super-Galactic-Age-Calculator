# Super Galactic Age Calculator

### Created by Sarah Gilbert

## Description

##### This back end only webpage was created to further my knowledge and skills by implementing the use of test driven development. Along with strengthening my skills with constructors, objects, and prototypes, this is also the first time I have implemented multiple new programs into my code such as webpack, jest and eslint. If functioning properly, this page should return the user's age back to them depending on what planet they are "residing" on. They will get results for Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, while also finding out how long they have left to live on each planet.
